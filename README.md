# Speech_to_Speech_Streaming
This project provides an automated system to translate the audio of video files into a target language. It involves transcribing the audio from the video, translating the transcribed text, converting the translated text into speech, adjusting the generated speech to match the video's audio duration, and replacing the original audio with the translated audio. The system uses advanced technologies like automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech conversion to create a seamless translation experience for multimedia content.
## Features:
- Upload a video file for processing.
- Specify a target language for translation.
- Translate spoken content from the video in real-time.
- Display the processed video after translation.
- Display the video name dynamically after the video has been processed.
### The static/uploads folder contains the input video, intermediate processed files, and the final output video file. All files are stored in this location once the code is executed.
